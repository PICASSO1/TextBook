JIRA makes it dangerously easy to implement overly bureaucratic processes. 
A certain kind of organization is drawn to it for that reason. 
Even a healthy organization switching to JIRA can get carried away with the tools now at its disposal.
JIRA is a software product but also a social institution, an organizational philosophy. 
Sure, you can have the software without the attitude or vice versa, but use of JIRA is still a (weak) negative signal about the quality of an employer.
Turns out that the main thing protecting employee autonomy is the logistical difficulty of micromanagement. JIRA “solves” that problem.

I fucking hate JIRA too, the interface is clunky and slow and makes me angry.

I hate Jira . You need to watch a few hours of tutorials to be able to understand this piece of crap.

Jira has become the Quark/Lotus Notes of this decade, 
whereby the only use case for having it is that the users believe the constant pain and limitations
experienced is a form of marketable work experience. 
The momentum of its user base plus incoherent analyst opinions only serve to discourage moving to something actually useful/modern/user centered/updated/etc.
