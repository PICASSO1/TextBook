Yeah, the Jira web app is ass slow. Thankfully all I need to do with Jira is read the ticket and maybe reply with some comments. 
All the workflow, tagging, and a billion required fields bullshit I punt off to my project manager to do.

I can’t even get to the search. Confluence wants me to select spaces to watch before letting me do anything. 
I want to find documentation on internal tools, I neither care about nor want updates on pages that I’ll get via email regardless.
I just get frustrated and close the window.

Confluence’s search is absolute trash. Unless you know the exact keywords, good luck finding what you’re looking for.

Confluence’s UI is awful. 
My company uses Confluence, but every time I try to search for things on it I give up before even trying, because it’s so hard just to find the text input for a search. 
Most pages are bare bones and super out of date, so my guess is that a lot of other engineers feel the same way.

We use JIRA. I hate it. It would absolutely not work well for helpdesk tickets. I use it for infosec projects and it works ok but I would rather use Trello.

I fucking hate Jira. I think it’s coming to become a job app filter for me. Do you use Jira? Yes? No Thanks.
